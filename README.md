# Web Lab 21 (CEITI)

Repositories with solved tasks.

## Tasks

1. Create an `input` field in an HTML document for entering a number. Add a `button` that, when clicked, displays the square of the entered number using an `alert`. Account for the scenario where the user enters a non-numeric value.

2. In an HTML document, create two `input` fields. Add a `button` that, when clicked, swaps the values of the input fields.

3. Given a `paragraph` and a `color selection` field, write a script that allows changing the text color of the paragraph to the selected color.

4. The HTML document contains a user `table` with two columns: first name and last name. Below the table, create a `form` that allows adding a new user to the table. When any cell is clicked, a `prompt` should appear to modify the cell’s text. Solve this task using event delegation (i.e., the event should be attached to the `table`).

5. There are two `input` fields for integers, `n` and `m`. Write a script that draws an `n` × `m` `table` and fills it with `random integers`.

6. The HTML document includes a `dropdown list` of countries. When a country is selected, a second `dropdown list` should appear nearby, listing cities from that country.
